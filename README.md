# Team College Bored - Jared Asch, Ryan Aday, Imad Belkebir

## Dependencies
- flask
- wheel
- sqlite3

To install all of these, run:
```bash
$ python3 -m venv <name>
$ . <name>/bin/activate # activate venv
$ pip3 install flask
$ pip3 install wheel
$ pip3 install sqlite
```

## Running our Project
Once all of the dependencies have been installed, all you need to to is create the database and run the main server file

```bash
# while venv is active
$ python3 utils/db_create.py
$ python3 utils/db_populate.py
# For default accounts
$ python3 app.py
```
##Functionality
When you open up the webpage, you can either login to the default accounts generated by db_populate or make your own account.
To make your own account, click the "Sign Up" link above.  This will send the user to a link for them to generate their account.
Once logged in/signed up, the user will be able to make posts by filling out the text box above and submitting that.
The user will be able to add to/edit their previous posts via an edit button, which redirects them to a different page for that feature.
If the user wants to log out, they can via the logout link.
